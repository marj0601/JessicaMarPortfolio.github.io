		<h2>Jeroo Unit 1</h2>
	    <h2>Description:</h2>
		<p>
		Use jeroo to make jeroos move across island with the basic functions. We had to create
		jeroos, and program them to complete a task with the functions: hop, pick, plant, and toss.
		During jeroo unit 1 we learned about the different things jeroos could do. 
		</p>
		<h2>Concepts Learned: </h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Creating jeroos - learned how to create a jeroo and make it appear on the screen</li>
			<li>Using hop, pick, and plant - learned how to use hop(), pick(), and plant(), so the
			jeroo could do different things on the island</li>
			<li>Multiple jeroos - used multiple jeroos to complete a task instead of repeating code
			many, many times to complete a task</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Jeroo Unit 2</h2>		
		<h2>Description:</h2>
		<p>
		Use jeroo methods to make the main method more organized and simpler. We created jeroo 
		methods to help repeat less amount of code over and over again. Creating jeroo methods 
		also helped finish the labs easier because the method could be applied to multiple jeroos.  
		</p>
		<h2>Concepts Learned: </h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Jeroo methods - Used methods to organize code and help the program much quicker.
			Methods help with shorter code in the main method and can be used in multiple jeroos.</li>
			<li>Creating shapes - Used methods to create shapes that have the same pattern. Created
			squares and boxes.</li>
			<li>Turning - Used the turn(LEFT); or turn(RIGHT); functions to make the jeroo turn left or right
			to reach a certain destination.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Jeroo Unit 3</h2>		
		<h2>Description:</h2>
		<p>
		Used loops to keep the jeroo doing a certain function until that statement is false. The while
		loop was used a lot to keep a jeroo hopping while the statement was true. We made spirals and
		pinballs. 
		</p>
		<h2>Concepts Learned: </h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Using the while loop - kept going on unless the statement inside the while loop was false</li>
			<li>Using boolean conditions - this is the code that is put into the while loop so the computer 
			knows that if the boolean condition is true, it will continue running that piece of code</li>
			<li>Direction - the direction that a jeroo faces helps determine was is ahead. We used the 
			isFlower(AHEAD); and isWater(AHEAD); inside the while loop</li>
		<h2>Jeroo Unit 4</h2>	
		<h2>Description:</h2>
		<p>
		Used loops to keep the jeroo doing a certain function until that statement is false. The if loop 
		was used a lot to keep that jeroo hopping while if the while loop statement wasnâ€™t true, the if 
		statement would be used to compensate for that. We completed mazes and alleys. 
		</p>
		<h2>Concepts Learned: </h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Using the if loop - if something inside the if loop occurs, then whatever is in the if 
			loop will go</li>
			<li>Using if else conditions - if something inside the if loop is false, then the else condition
			will be used and what is in the else condition will be used</li>
			<li>Recursion - we used the recursion to keep the program going based off of what happened at the
			last place the jeroo was</li>
