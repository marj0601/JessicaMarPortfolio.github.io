		<h2>Python Unit 1</h2>
	    <h2>Description:</h2>
		<p>
		 Learn the basics of Python through the Python Shell. We also learned about getting the 
		 computer to do specific math functions using the Python Shell and creating methods. In
		 addition, we learned how to use classes, set up parameters and learn how to use pygame.
		 In pygame, we learned about user interaction and based of a specific key that the user 
		 pressed, the image in pygame would move.
		</p>
		<h2>Concepts Learned: </h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Python basics - Learned how to print in the python shell, escape sequences, variables,
			user input, input with numbers, math operators</li>
			<li>Escape sequences - I used this to get numbers of letters in a word to move to the
			next line and how to make quotations or backslashes appear when printed</li>
			<li>Variables - Used this to help control values that change</li>
			<li>Boolean statements - Helps determine what the computer will do based on a specific
			situation. The statement is a true or false, so the answer is either true or false</li>
			<li>Strings - Helped me write numbers in the python shell after user input</li>
			<li>Classes - Gives the class attributes to be able to receive input from other objects
			or the user </li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Python Unit 2</h2>		
		<h2>Description:</h2>
		<p>
		Use if statements to respond to user input. If the user pressed a key, then in pygame, 
		the person would move up, down, right, and left. We also learned about how to collide 
		with other objects using if-elses so that the person wouldn’t be able to go through 
		the wall. In the last lab for this unit, we learned how to allow the person to hop over
		the wall by using nested if statements.
		</p>
		<h2>Concepts Learned: </h2>
		<ul>
			<li>If statements - Used if statements to receive user input. For the person, if the
			user pressed the up, down, right, left arrows, the person would go up, down, right, and left</li>
			<li>Python methods - I created methods for the person in collision so that the person 
			couldn’t go through the wall</li>
			<li>If-else statements - Helped with detecting collision so that the person couldn’t go
			through the wall</li>
			<li>Nested if statements - I used this by creating an upCounter variable that after
			the person got to a certain height, he would start going down, without having to 
			program a down arrow for the person to go down </li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Python Unit 3</h2>		
		<h2>Description:</h2>
		<p>
		Used loops to continuously run a function unless something else happens. I learned how
		to make the seconds tick down in the python shell in the timer lab, and make multiple 
		squares and circles that got smaller and smaller each timer in the squares and circles 
		lab. I also learned about how to make objects be placed randomly on the screen in 
		addition to using nested loops to draw tiles in the tiles lab. 
		</p>
		<h2>Concepts Learned: </h2>
		<ul>
			<li>For loops - I used this to help run a function a set number of times in the 
			python shell as I did with the amount of seconds in the timer in the timer lab</li>
			<li>For each loops - I used this to check each character inside the loop and see
			if it is true before running the program again and again</li>
			<li>While loops - This kept the program running as long as it was true inside.
			I used this in the squaresAndCircles lab to keep making squares and circles</li>
			<li>While loops - This kept the program running as long as it was true inside.
			I used this in the squaresAndCircles lab to keep making squares and circles</li>
			<li>Nested loops - I used this in the tiles lab to randomly place 30 rocks
			across the screen and draw all of the grass</li>
		</ul>	
		<h2>Python Unit 4</h2>	
		<h2>Description:</h2>
		<p>
		In this unit I learned about lists and how it can organize and better access an 
		object in the list. I also learned how to change costumes based on which direction
		the person was going to make it better look like the person was actually walking.
		I changed the ground by addied a combination of road and grass tiles to make a path
		in the middle of the screen. In addition, I used lists to create multiple enemies 
		that moved across the screen on the road. 
		</p>
		<h2>Concepts Learned: </h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Lists - Helped me change my person’s costumes based on which direction he was moving</li>
			<li>Different tiles - I used different tiles and even combination of tiles to create a path
			in the middle of the screen that was also surrounded by grass</li>
			<li>Lists - I used list to control the number of enemies and the direction that they were
			moving without having to create a lot of different enemy class files</li>
		</ul>	
		<h2>Python Final Project</h2>	
		<h2>Description:</h2>
		<p>
		 For my python final project I created a maze and the elf would have to reach to cookie before
		 the time ran out to win. The elf would start at the top left corner at ( 0, 0 ) and make it 
		 to the cookie. If the elf doesn’t reach the cookie before time runs out, then the game is 
		 over. If the elf gets the cupcake, then the time is increased by 3. 
		</p>
		<h2>Concepts Learned: </h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Lists - I used lists like a matrix to create a series of 1’s and 0’s to create the maze</li>
			<li>Sizing - I had to resize my elf to fit between the walls of the maze</li>
			<li>Level - I created a variable to control the level so that when a key was pressed it would
			start at level 1</li>
			<li>Start screen - I created a start screen so that when 1 was pressed it would go to level
			1 and when 2 was pressed it would go to level 2</li>
		</ul>
