	<h2>Why I like the movie</h2>
	<p>This is my favorite movie because I love the storyline. I like how this movie is a spin on the classic The Wizard of Oz. 
	The movie takes place in a more modern time which I like but it still has a lot of the characters that I love from the 
	Wizard of Oz. It also is my favorite because this movie also has a lot of surprises in store that aren't in the Wizard of Oz.
	</p>
	<h2>Favorite Actress</h2>
	<p>My favorite actress the movie is Mila Kunis. She does a really good job of playing both good and evil. At the beginning 
	of the movie, she is a good witch and as the movie progresses, she turns evil. She does a great job changing the characters 
	personality throughout the movie.
