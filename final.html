		<h2>Final Project: Scratch Game</h2>
		<h2>Treasure Hunting</h2>
	    <h2>Description:</h2>
		<p>I used the concepts that we learned throughout the year to create a scratch game called treasure hunting.
		I created a witch that moves up, down, right, and left based on which buttons the user pushes. I also created
		beachballs that the witch must avoid. If the witch touches the beach balls, the game is over. I added prizes
		in each level, that the witch can try to collect. To move onto the next level, the witch must reach the right
		end of the screen. To win the game, the user must successfully complete all 5 levels. At the winning screen,
		it will display all the prizes that were collected. </p>
		<h2>Concepts Learned: </h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Lists - I learned how to further use lists to store items to later access. I used a list to
			keep track of the prizes collected throughout the game</li>
			<li>Changing X and Y - I learned to change the x and y of the witch before changing the backdrop
			so that it would switch to the correct backdrop</li>
			<li>Loops - I learned how to create a loop so that the beach ball would roll until it got the the
			left edge of the screen</li>
			<li>Show and hide - I used a lot of show and hide blocks to show and hide different treasures when
			they were collected</li>
			<li>Making blocks - I made many blocks and that really helped me with shortening my code that I kept
			repeating over and over again</li>
		</ul>
